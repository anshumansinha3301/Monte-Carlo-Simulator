# Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulator (Python)

The Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulator is an advanced Python project designed to model the potential future outcomes of an investment portfolio under uncertainty. By leveraging Monte Carlo simulations, the project generates thousands of hypothetical scenarios to estimate portfolio growth, volatility, and risk. This approach allows users to understand the range of possible results, including best-case, worst-case, and median outcomes, providing a more realistic picture of long-term portfolio behavior compared to simple deterministic calculations.

This project allows users to define an initial investment, expected annual return, volatility, investment horizon, and number of simulations. For each scenario, the portfolio value evolves year by year according to a random return sampled from a normal distribution. After running the simulations, the tool calculates key statistics, including mean and median final values, percentiles, and the probability of losing capital. These metrics give a comprehensive view of potential investment outcomes and help users make informed decisions based on risk tolerance.

The Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulator is implemented entirely in Python using only the standard library, making it accessible, lightweight, and easy to extend. Users can experiment with different inputs such as higher volatility, longer investment periods, or larger simulation counts to explore how changes in assumptions impact potential outcomes. The project provides a practical introduction to stochastic modeling, financial risk assessment, and portfolio management concepts.

Beyond its educational value, this simulator serves as a foundation for more sophisticated financial analysis tools. It can be extended to model multi-asset portfolios, correlated returns, or scenario-based stress testing. By combining probability theory, statistical modeling, and investment principles, the Monte Carlo Portfolio Simulator bridges theoretical finance with hands-on Python programming. It is an ideal Hacktoberfest project for contributors interested in quantitative finance, risk modeling, or financial data science.
